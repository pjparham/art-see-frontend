# Welcome to ArtSee
ArtSee is a platform that allows users to upload their favorite works of art and review them. On the homepage, artworks can be sorted alphabetically by name or by review count. Each artwork's review count can be clicked and will redirect the user to a page showing details of the artpiece as well as its reviews. The artwork's page also includes a form to edit information about the artwork and a button to delete an artwork and all of its associated reviews. The top right of the page features a link to a page with a form where users can add their favorite artworks that are not already featured on the site. 

# Getting started with ArtSee
To run ArtSee on your computer, please fork and clone the repo. Once you have navigated to file in your terminal, run npm start to get the app running. You will also need to fork and clone the [backend for ArtSee](https://github.com/pjparham/phase-3-sinatra-react-project).


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
