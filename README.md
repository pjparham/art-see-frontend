# Welcome to ArtSee
ArtSee is a platform that allows users to upload their favorite works of art and review them. On the homepage, artworks can be sorted alphabetically by name or by review count. Each artwork's review count can be clicked and will redirect the user to a page showing details of the artpiece as well as its reviews. The artwork's page also includes a form to edit information about the artwork and a button to delete an artwork and all of its associated reviews. The top right of the page features a link to a page with a form where users can add their favorite artworks that are not already featured on the site.
